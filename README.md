# Antoine's dotfiles

Hello World :wave:

This repository is a replacement of [my former dotfiles](https://github.com/aneveux/dotfiles) that were provisioned with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/).

I am now using [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) as a dotfiles manager, and I am very happy with it so far.

Obviously these are my personal dotfiles, and I wouldn't recommend you to use them without customization. I am sharing them publicly as it is sometimes interesting to get a little inspiration from others' environments though.
